Creating a new Project
======================

First you have to install `Cookiecutter <https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter>`_:

::

    $ pip install cookiecutter

After that change to the directory where you want to create a your new Django
project in. Then set up the project using this cookiecutter template like so:

::

    $ cookiecutter gh:transcode-de/cookiecutter-django-project

You have to answer a few questions to configure the project. The defaults are
good for transcode projects - surely you want to override them for yours.

Next Steps
==========

Change into your newly created project directory and execute the following
commands to get started.

You should create a new virtualenv for the project:

::

    $ mkvirtualenv -a `pwd` my-project


Install the packages for development:

::

    $ make develop

Then create the new PostgreSQL user and database:

::

    $ make create-db-user
    $ make create-db

The next step is to create the Django app(s) you want for the project. Just run
the ``startapp`` task to create new Django app(s):

::

    $ make startapp

Now create the database tables:

::

    $ make migrate

And create a new Django superuser:

::

    $ envdir envs/dev/ python manage.py createsuperuser

Finally start the development webserver:

::

    $ make runserver

To see the other targets available in the ``Makefile`` simply run:

::

    $ make

Detailed installation instructions can be found in your new project under
``docs/installation.rst``.
